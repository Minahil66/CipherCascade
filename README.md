#CipherCascade

A C++ program that encrypts and decrypts files using multiple cipher algorithms that can be chained together (like Vignere→ XOR → atbash) for layered security, 
allowing users to choose their preferred cipher combination.

It is the fundamental of strong cryptographic understanding, and is used for saving encrypted files in cloud servers and military service
